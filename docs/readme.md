## Selections

* If you select just a couple of lines, only those lines will be processed.
* In VS Code you can use multiple selections (alt+click) to select multiple comment blocks
  or line ranges.
* However you can safely select a large line range with multiple comments and code, and
  only the comments will be wrapped (the code is untouched). You can `Ctrl+A, Alt+Q` to
  re-wrap a whole document at once.
